## About Me

I am the author of the [dropt](https://github.com/jamesderlin/dropt) command-line option parsing library.

Former software engineer at Google.

I was a software engineer at VMware for many years, where I was a Windows UI developer on VMware Workstation, VMware Player, and VMware Remote Console (VMRC).  I wrote [VMware KVM](https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2014/03/whats-cool-vmware-kvm-utility.html).

Before that, I worked for Sony Electronics writing Palm OS software for its CLI&Eacute; line of PDAs.
