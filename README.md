## About Me

I am the author of the [dropt](https://github.com/jamesderlin/dropt) command-line option parsing library.

Long-time software engineer at VMware, where I am a Windows UI developer on VMware Workstation, VMware Player, and VMware Remote Console (VMRC).  I wrote [VMware KVM](https://web.archive.org/web/20250402202334/https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2014/03/whats-cool-vmware-kvm-utility.html).

I also had a stint as a software engineer at Google working on [Flutter](https://www.flutter.dev/)-related projects.

Before that, I worked for Sony Electronics writing Palm OS software for its [CLI&Eacute;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLI%C3%89) line of PDAs.
